Hey there,

This is John from the AWS Educate team. Hope you're doing well and are staying safe. Firstly, Id like to take a moment to let you know that AWS is truly concerned about everyone’s safety during this pandemic situation and we are all together in this. 

I understand from your request that you have certain queries with with regards to AWS Educate and its specifications offered. Please find the below answers to your questions:

1) If I clicked my profile, it said IAM access denied. 1) Is it normal? And how I can resolve this permission?

A) Please be informed, the IAM feature is completely not available on Educate Starter Account & as they are provided and managed by a third party (Vocareum). It has been systematized in such a way that you can only create users, but cannot associate login profile or access keys for them. 

However, not to worry, I can completely help you out with the list of services that are supported by the Educate Starter account and you should be able to get a detailed overview regarding the same. You can refer to the below link for more information:

- https://awseducate-starter-account-services.s3.amazonaws.com/AWS_Educate_Starter_Account_Services_Supported.pdf 

2) How could I sign in with Root user of Starter Account?

A) Educate Starter account does not have an IAM or Root user login. It accepts single sign in only, however, you can login to your portal with the provided email address & password and choose ‘AWS account’ tab to automatically get redirected to the vocareum labs.

3) Where can I find AccessKeyId & SecretAccessKey to train SC3?

A) Please be informed, Educate Starter account does not support creating access keys & SecretAccesskeys. Educate is a student platform only with limited resources and services. However, since you already have an existing AWS account, you can certainly try finding the same there, since its a vast platform with hardly any restrictions on services as per your plan.

Also, here are few benefits of using an Educate Starter account: 

* Credits are pre-loaded to your Starter Account Lab
* ESA does not require a credit card and it will not be possible to incur charges beyond the provided credit
* No payment method and phone number necessary for verification and activation 
* No unexpected charges can ever incur with a Starter Account

Trust you'll find this information helpful but please let me know if you've any questions or need any further assistance, will be more than happy to help. 

Wish you a great day ahead!

Best regards,

John N.
